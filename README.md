# About me
### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vinuthna, a student passionate about data science. Currently, I'm learning data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. Through this repository, I aim to document my learning path, share projects, and keep track of my growth in the field of data science.
## Skills
Programming: Python, R
Libraries/Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
Data Handling: Data cleaning, transformation, and visualization
Machine Learning: Basic supervised and unsupervised learning models
Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis testing, regression, probability
Version Control: Git & GitHub
## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
## Student Resume Designer
The Student Resume Designer project is a tool designed to help students create professional, customizable resumes quickly and easily. It allows users to input their personal information, educational background, skills, experience, and more. The application generates a clean, well-organized resume template in various formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) that can be tailored to individual preferences.

It allows users (property buyers, sellers, and agents) to submit, track, and manage property registration details securely. The system includes features for document uploading, verification, payment processing, and approval workflows to ensure accurate property records and legal compliance.
## Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
Backend: Python (Django/Flask), Node.js 
Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL
## Goals
Learn more advanced machine learning techniques.
Work on real-world datasets.
Contribute to open-source data science projects.
Continue improving my skills with hands-on projects and challenges.
